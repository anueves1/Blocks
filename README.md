This project contains a scene where a certain number of blocks(50 x 50 by default) appear 
at the start, there is a probablity value that is used to make blocks not spawn at random places.

# Movement:

The scene has a Camera (Player) that can move using the usual Unity Editor Camera controls.

# Place Mode:

You can also press B to enter place mode, where you can click on nodes (Little red dots) to place a block on them.
